A Python repository for exploring outcomes and behaviors related to game theory and the prisoner's dilemma

### Getting Started:
Run the build Script:
`python build.py`

(Or, if you have multiple versions of Python installed: `python3 build.py` -- This builds JSON data on the available AI's)
This _only_ needs to be run once unless you are adding new AI's.

Start the interface:
`python game_theory.py`
